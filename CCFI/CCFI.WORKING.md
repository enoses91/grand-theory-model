## Entries

### PROMOTED

#### CCF-0001 — Selective Enforcement → Expectation Uncertainty → Fear-Based Compliance

**Steps**

- Selective/uneven enforcement creates uncertainty about rules and penalties
- Uncertainty increases perceived downside variance
- Actors shift from cooperative norms to defensive compliance
- Defensive compliance increases procedural load and reduces throughput

**Fields and metrics**

- Governance field (Gv): enforcement regime, backlog, queueing dynamics
- φ: procedural legitimacy (predictability), compliance willingness
- θ: throughput and execution capacity under load
- κ: compression under uncertainty and time poverty

**Directionality and lag**

- Enforcement shifts can be rapid; legitimacy recovery is slow and asymmetric
- Compliance load rises quickly; θ_eff declines with delay via backlog accumulation

**Regime/scale bounds**

- Strongest in high-scrutiny regimes with many veto points
- Scales with coordination complexity and enforcement visibility

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Credible proceduralization (predictable rules applied evenly) breaks the chain
- High exit options can substitute for compliance (market-mediated governance)

**Common misuses**

- Inferring “fear-based compliance” implies moral collapse or irrationality
- Treating enforcement intensity as the only lever (predictability matters more)

**Status:** `promoted`  
**Confidence:** `high`


#### CCF-0002 — Promise Load → Throughput Failure → Legitimacy Decay → Enforcement Burden

**Steps**

- Promises/commitments exceed feasible throughput
- Visible delivery failures accumulate (promise gap widens)
- Procedural legitimacy decays (φ↓)
- Compliance falls; enforcement burden rises
- Rising burden further reduces θ_eff, increasing failures

**Fields and metrics**

- φ: legitimacy and consent
- θ: execution throughput and backlog
- I-field: visibility/amplification of failures
- Gv: backlog/queueing and service experience feedback

**Directionality and lag**

- Promise load can increase instantly; failure accumulation is lagged
- Legitimacy decay is persistent; repair requires sustained delivery

**Regime/scale bounds**

- Large-scale institutions with high visibility and low slack
- Stronger where I-field gain is high and alternatives are salient

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- De-scope promises or sequence them after θ repair
- Improve throughput before increasing obligations

**Common misuses**

- Treating legitimacy as “messaging” only
- Assuming more enforcement can substitute for φ

**Status:** `promoted`  
**Confidence:** `high`


### CANDIDATE

#### CCF-0003 — Administrative Complexity → Time Poverty → Compression → Execution Collapse

**Steps**

- Administrative gates and rules increase cognitive/temporal load
- Time poverty (E_τ↓) increases κ
- κ reduces decision quality and increases error/rewind
- θ_eff declines; backlog rises; execution collapses

**Fields and metrics**

- θ: execution capacity
- κ: compression
- E_τ: temporal surplus
- Gv: backlog and procedural gates

**Directionality and lag**

- Complexity increases gradually; collapse can be abrupt at thresholds
- Recovery is slower than decline due to hysteresis in process

**Regime/scale bounds**

- Bureaucratic systems with many approvals and audit surfaces
- Most visible in procurement, security compliance, and regulated domains

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Administrative simplification and gate reduction
- Delegation + clarity of authority scope

**Common misuses**

- Moralizing “bureaucrats are lazy”
- Ignoring time as a binding constraint

**Status:** `candidate`  
**Confidence:** `medium`


#### CCF-0004 — Information Gain → Compression → Hardening → Overton Narrowing

**Steps**

- I-field amplification increases salience load and conflict visibility
- κ rises; causal discrimination falls
- h rises via identity salience and purity incentives
- Overton window narrows; discourse policing increases

**Fields and metrics**

- I-field: amplification and attention density
- κ: compression
- h: hardening and hysteresis
- φ: procedural legitimacy vs moral imbalance

**Directionality and lag**

- κ responds quickly; h responds slower but is hysteretic
- Overton narrowing can happen rapidly once h crosses threshold

**Regime/scale bounds**

- High-velocity information environments
- Stronger under low pluralism and contested φ-procedural

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Reduce amplification / change topology
- Restore procedural legitimacy via credible performance

**Common misuses**

- Treating as ideology-specific (it is symmetric)
- Treating censorship alone as cause rather than symptom of h

**Status:** `candidate`  
**Confidence:** `medium`


#### CCF-0005 — Vendor Refusal → Operational Degradation → Backlog Growth → Legitimacy Loss

**Steps**

- Payment delays / procurement failures reduce vendor willingness
- Service quality degrades; outages and delays increase
- Backlog accumulates; θ_eff declines
- Visible failures reduce φ and increase enforcement/triage burdens

**Fields and metrics**

- M-field: vendor response and exchange constraints
- θ: execution/operations throughput
- E: surplus and payment capacity
- Gv: backlog/queue dynamics
- I-field: visibility of failures

**Directionality and lag**

- Vendor refusal can be sudden; operational degradation compounds
- φ decay lags but persists

**Regime/scale bounds**

- Vendor-concentrated markets
- High dependency on contractors/procurement

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Stabilize payment reliability
- Reduce scope and restore minimum maintenance bandwidth

**Common misuses**

- Treating vendor action as pure “leverage play” without capacity context
- Ignoring technical debt compounding

**Status:** `candidate`  
**Confidence:** `low`


#### CCF-0006 — Exit Option Value → Voice Decline → Institutional Drift

**Steps**

- Exit options (X) become cheaper/more attractive for high-capacity actors
- Voice declines; reform capacity falls
- Institutions drift toward lower-throughput equilibria
- Decline accelerates via selection effects (who remains)

**Fields and metrics**

- X: exit/mobility
- θ: execution responsiveness
- E: opportunity cost differentials
- CI: competence retention and institutional learning

**Directionality and lag**

- Exit can spike after shocks; drift is slow but compounding
- Reversal requires rebuilding trust and responsiveness over time

**Regime/scale bounds**

- Federal/fragmented systems with geographic arbitrage
- Professional labor markets with high mobility

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Reduce barriers to voice; increase responsiveness
- Lower coercion cost relative to mobility

**Common misuses**

- Treating exit as “apathy”
- Assuming exit reduces conflict (selection can worsen it)

**Status:** `candidate`  
**Confidence:** `medium`


#### CCF-0007 — Narrative Credit–Blame Asymmetry → Learning Failure → Basin Hardening

**Steps**

- Positive outcomes are attributed to intent/technique
- Negative outcomes are attributed to shocks or opponents
- Asymmetric attribution blocks learning and honest measurement
- κ/h rise under moralized narratives, hardening basins

**Fields and metrics**

- I-field: narrative selection and amplification
- MGA attribution error layer: agency inflation/erasure
- κ: causal discrimination loss
- h: identity hardening

**Directionality and lag**

- Attribution distortion is immediate; learning failure compounds
- Basin hardening increases over time via reinforcement

**Regime/scale bounds**

- High-polarization environments
- Low observability of causal mechanisms

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Measurement regimes + symmetric accounting
- Explicit intent vs mechanism auditing

**Common misuses**

- Confusing rhetorical claims with causal evidence
- Over-attributing centralized intent absent operator evidence

**Status:** `candidate`  
**Confidence:** `high`


#### CCF-0008 — Demographic Shock → Identity Activation → Segregation → Hardening

**Steps**

- Demographic shock (objective or perceived) increases identity salience
- Topology shifts toward segregation / clustering
- I-field reinforcement increases out-group threat salience
- h increases with hysteresis; polarization rises

**Fields and metrics**

- D-field: demographic change distributions and salience
- 𝒢: topology/segregation/broker mass
- I-field: amplification
- h: hardening
- φ: procedural legitimacy and pluralism

**Directionality and lag**

- Shock can be rapid; segregation can accelerate quickly
- Hardening persists after the initial shock

**Regime/scale bounds**

- Stronger when integrative institutions are weak
- Higher risk under high I-field gain

**Known breaks / alternatives**

- Strengthen cross-cutting ties and institutions
- Reduce amplification; increase procedural predictability

**Common misuses**

- Treating perception as irrelevant
- Treating identity activation as requiring deliberate incitement

**Status:** `candidate`  
**Confidence:** `low`
