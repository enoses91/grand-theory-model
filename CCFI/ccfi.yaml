# Causal Chain Fragment Inventory (CCFI) — WORKING / PROVISIONAL
# WARNING:
# - Entries are explanatory fragments, not laws.
# - Chains do not introduce new causal primitives or intent.
# - Not admissible without regime, scale, and temporal validation.
# - Must be instantiated with evidence (OCF) and audited via MGA-B.
# - Promotion path: repeated successful use + MGA-B survival + MGA-T routing.
