# O.2.RLM.INFORMATION_TOPOLOGY

## COR OBJECT HEADER

- **O_ID:** O.2.RLM.INFORMATION_TOPOLOGY
- **Name:** Information–Topology (Amplification & Convergence Mechanism)
- **Order:** 2nd
- **Kind:** Regime-Local Mechanism (RLM)
- **Role:** Regime-bounded mechanism by which Information Field propagation over a given coordination topology 𝒢 produces selective amplification, convergence, and distortion under salience incentives and penalty asymmetries, without requiring centralized intent or shared belief.
- **Status:** Canonical
- **Version:** 1.2
- **Changelog:**
  - v1.0: Canonical mechanism formalization; distinguishes propagation effects from beliefs and intent.
  - v1.1: Integrated COR.KAPPA compression, COR.H boundary effects, and MCI diagnostics.
  - **v1.2:** Reconciled to explicitly reference **σ, 𝓜, Π_k, U_k, W_{G→U}**, and bounded forcing semantics **J_z(·)**; removed residual agency language; aligned fully with Field/Bound/RLM discipline.

## 0. Indexing, Non-Agency, and RLM Form

**Indexing**
- **Manifold:** 𝓜
- **Scale:** σ (effective coordination scale; determines correlation length and amplification reach)
- **Topology:** 𝒢(σ,t)

**Non-Agency Constraint (hard)**
- Information–Topology is a **mechanism**, not an actor or pattern.
- It contains **no intent, no beliefs, no preferences, and no coordination objectives**.
- Macro-level convergence may arise even when all upstream actions are independent.
- Observed convergence **must not be treated as evidence of coordination** absent control-surface artifacts.

---

## 1. Base Definition (O⁰)

**Information–Topology is a regime-local mechanism in which the structure of interaction networks (𝒢), combined with Information Field propagation operators and incentive gradients, produces selective amplification and convergence of signals across 𝓜 at scale σ.**

Formally:

- Given an Information Field state \(\rho_I(x,\sigma,t)\),
- And a propagation operator \(\Pi_I\),
- The topology 𝒢 alone can induce macro-level convergence,
- Without centralized control, shared intent, or explicit coordination.

This mechanism is the **causal substrate** for **Macro-Coordination Illusory (MCI)** phenomena.

---

## 2. Refinements (ΔO)

### 2.1 Mechanism, not pattern

- INFORMATION–TOPOLOGY is a **mechanism** (causal channel).
- It can activate or sustain **patterns** (e.g., Salience-Driven Basin Hardening),
  but it is not itself a pattern.
- It is **conditionally active**, not inevitable.

---

### 2.2 Amplification asymmetry (structural)

Amplification is asymmetric due to:

- Attention scarcity and engagement weighting
- Penalty gradients for deviation (formal or informal)
- Algorithmic or institutional affordances
- Visibility cascades and reputational risk

Result:
- Some frames amplify superlinearly,
- Others decay regardless of truth or utility.

No asymmetry implies intent.

---

## 3. Formal Mechanism Structure

Let:

- \(\rho_I(x,\sigma,t)\): Information Field state distribution
- \(\Pi_I \equiv \Pi_k|_{k=I}\): propagation operator
- \(U_I \equiv U_k|_{k=I}\): information-relevant control surfaces
- \(\mathcal{G}(\sigma,t)\): coordination topology
- \(\kappa\): cognitive compression
- \(h\): boundary hardness

Then:

\[
\partial_t \rho_I
= \Pi_I(\rho_I;\mathcal{G},\sigma)
+ A_I(\text{salience},\text{penalty})
- D_I(\text{decay})
\]

Key properties:
- \(\kappa \downarrow\) → low-dimensional framing dominates
- \(h \uparrow\) → module-local reinforcement and echoing
- No intent term appears in the dynamics

---

## 4. Conditioning Variables (Regime Dependence)

### 4.1 COR.KAPPA — Cognitive Compression
High COR.KAPPA compression increases:
- sloganization
- frame dominance
- loss of nuance and correction

### 4.2 COR.H — Boundary Hardness
High COR.H increases:
- in-group reinforcement
- out-group penalty salience
- fragmentation across modules

### 4.3 𝒢 — Topology
- Centralized hubs → rapid convergence
- Modular networks → polarized convergence
- Sparse networks → weak amplification

### 4.4 W_{G→U} — Weighted Access
Group-weighted access to information-relevant control surfaces (media, platforms, institutions)
modulates **which signals enter Π_I with high visibility**, without implying coordination.

---

## 5. Forcing-Term Couplings (Operator-Safe)

Information–Topology induces **bounded forcing** into downstream variables:

- **Cognitive compression (COR.KAPPA):**
\[
\partial_t \kappa = \ldots + J_\kappa^{(+)}(\rho_I,\Pi_I,U_I;\sigma)
\]
(salience overload, simplification pressure)

- **Boundary hardness (COR.H):**
\[
\partial_t h = \ldots + J_h^{(+)}(\rho_I,\Pi_I,U_I;\sigma)
\]
(identity reinforcement, exclusion dynamics)

- **Legitimacy (COR.PHI):**
\[
\partial_t \phi = \ldots + J_\phi^{(-)}(\rho_I,\Pi_I,U_I;\sigma)
\]
(perceived asymmetry, inconsistency exposure)

- **Governance capacity load (COR.THETA):**
\[
\partial_t \theta = \ldots + J_\theta^{(-)}(\rho_I,\Pi_I,U_I;\sigma)
\]
(salience-driven demand shocks, attention diversion)

All \(J_z(\cdot)\) terms are **bounded, non-agentic, and scale-conditioned**.

---

## 6. Activation Conditions (Regime-Local)

The mechanism becomes active when **all** hold:

1. Topology supports clustering or central amplification
2. Attention is scarce relative to signal volume
3. Penalty gradients exist for deviation
4. COR.KAPPA is compressed
5. Propagation speed exceeds correction speed

Absent these, information diffusion remains pluralistic and weakly correlated.

---

## 7. Observable Signatures (Diagnostic, Not Proof)

- Rapid narrative convergence without control artifacts
- High lexical similarity across independent actors
- Issue dominance driven by isolated or low-base-rate events
- Punitive enforcement against heterodox framing
- Private–public belief divergence

These distinguish **MCI** from **MCR** when combined with control-surface audits.

---

## 8. Scale and Time Properties

- **Scale:** mesoscopic → macro via correlation length (σ-dependent)
- **Time constants:**
  - onset: fast (shock- or salience-driven)
  - decay: slow if topology and incentives persist
- **Hysteresis:** reversal requires topology or incentive change, not rebuttal

---

## 9. MGA Integration

- **Used in:** MGA-B, MGA-C
- **Required audits:**
  - Mechanism vs Pattern Audit
  - Attribution Audit (no intent without artifacts)
  - Control-Surface Presence Check
  - Scale Consistency Audit (explicit σ)
- **Default disposition:** **Bound** unless signatures and topology conditions are met

---

## 10. Misuse Prohibitions (Strict)

Invalid uses include:
- Treating convergence as proof of coordination
- Inferring intent without Π/U artifacts
- Moralizing propagation outcomes
- Ignoring topology in narrative analysis
- Collapsing this mechanism into ideology or belief

Violations indicate **intent attribution error** or **projection failure**.

---

## 11. Reduction Check (Robustness Contract)

As ΔO → 0:

> Information propagates and amplifies according to network structure and incentives, not intent.

Mechanism semantics preserved.
Object passes robustness, boundedness, and regime-local tests.
