# OBJECT.INDIVIDUAL

## COR OBJECT HEADER

- **O_ID:** OBJECT.INDIVIDUAL
- **Name:** Individual
- **Order:** 3rd
- **Kind:** Domain Object (Atomic Carrier)
- **Role:** Defines the atomic carrier of cognitive capacity, traits, incentive exposure, and lived experience within manifold 𝓜; individuals are units of selection and learning but do not possess macro-scale agency.
- **Status:** Canonical
- **Version:** 1.2
- **Changelog:**
  - v1.0: Canonical Individual object; formalized individuals as carriers (not actors), attached g and axes, enforced non-agency at macro scale.
  - **v1.2:** Reconciled to explicitly reference **σ, 𝓜**, field/state projections, and selection–treatment discipline; removed residual micro-agency leakage; aligned with Tier-2 Fields, Bounds, and Tier-3 objects.

---

## 0. Indexing, Non-Agency, and Object Form

**Indexing**
- **Manifold:** 𝓜
- **Scale:** σ_i (individual scale; lowest σ admissible)

**Non-Agency Constraint (hard)**
- An Individual is **not** an actor at system scale.
- Individuals possess **no governance, no access weights, no control-surface leverage, and no execution capacity**.
- Individuals cannot be assigned responsibility for regime, field, or system outcomes.
- Any analysis attributing macro outcomes to individual intent violates scale consistency.

---

## 1. Base Definition (O⁰)

**An Individual is the smallest analytic unit that carries cognitive capacity, traits, incentive exposure, and experience.**

Individuals answer:

> *How do constraints and incentives register at the micro level?*

They do **not** answer:
- who governs,
- who coordinates,
- who acts at scale,
- why regimes change.

Individuals are **carriers**, not controllers.

---

## 2. Formal Structure

An individual \(i\) is represented as:

\[
i
\;\equiv\;
\langle
g_i,\
\mathbf{a}_i,\
E_i^{eff},\
X_i^{eff},\
\kappa_i,\
\mathcal{M}_i,\
\mathcal{C}_i
\rangle
\]

Where:

- \(g_i\): cognitive capacity (O.1.METRIC.G)
- \(\mathbf{a}_i\): vector of individual traits / axes (Tier-3)
- \(E_i^{eff}\): effective surplus exposure (Tier-1, class-conditioned)
- \(X_i^{eff}\): effective exit / mobility option value
- \(\kappa_i\): experienced cognitive compression (projection of system COR.KAPPA)
- \(\mathcal{M}_i\): group memberships (possibly multiple; nullable)
- \(\mathcal{C}_i\): cluster alignments (fuzzy, non-exclusive)

All components are bounded, time-indexed, and σ-specific.

---

## 3. Selection vs Treatment Discipline (Locked)

### 3.1 Selection (dominant)

Most observed population outcomes reflect **selection**, not intervention:

- educational sorting
- occupational sorting
- group membership
- geographic mobility
- survival and persistence under stress

Selection operates through **constraints**, not intent.

---

### 3.2 Treatment (secondary, bounded)

Treatments act on individuals only via constraints imposed by:

- time availability \(E_\tau\)
- cognitive capacity \(g\)
- compression \(κ\) (`COR.KAPPA`)
- institutional friction (`COR.CI`)
- regime feasibility (Bounds)

No treatment bypasses these constraints.

This object enforces the **Selection–Treatment Guardrail** across MGA.

---

## 4. What Individuals Carry (and What They Do Not)

### 4.1 Carried

- cognitive capacity \(g\)
- traits / dispositions
- incentive exposure
- class position (as constraint)
- experience and memory of shocks

### 4.2 Not carried

- intent at system scale
- governance authority
- access weights \(W\) (`OCF.OPERATOR.WEIGHTED_ACCESS`)
- coherence \(χ\) (`COR.CHI`)
- ideology as causal force

Beliefs exist but are **analytically downstream** and non-causal at macro scale.

---

## 5. Relationship to Core Objects (Locked)

### 5.1 Class
- Individuals occupy class positions.
- Class constrains feasible behavior; it does not encode belief.

### 5.2 Cluster
- Individuals may align statistically into clusters.
- Cluster membership is descriptive and non-binding.

### 5.3 Group
- Individuals may be members of groups.
- Group action requires χ (`COR.CHI`) and Γ_G (`COR.G`).
- Individual dissent does not negate group action if χ is high.

### 5.4 Regime
- Individuals exist *within* regimes.
- Regimes condition incentives; individuals do not shape regimes directly.

---

## 6. Incentive Exposure (Projection, Not Choice)

Individuals experience local incentive gradients generated by:

- metric variables (`COR.PHI`, `COR.THETA`, `COR.E`, `COR.X`),
- state variables (`COR.KAPPA`, `COR.H`),
- active fields (Market, Information, Governance, Violence, etc.),
- class position and exit asymmetry.

Incentives are **emergent projections** of system structure, not preferences.

---

## 7. Exit, Compliance, and Exposure

At the individual level:

- **Exit pressure** depends on \(X_i^{eff}\) and class.
- **Compliance pressure** depends on COR.PHI, enforcement asymmetry, and `COR.H`.
- **Variance exposure** depends on class and regime configuration.

Observed behavior reflects **constraint response**, not moral choice.

---

## 8. Time Dynamics

- Traits: stable
- Cognitive capacity: stable
- Incentive exposure: fast-changing
- Learning: slow and bounded
- Mobility: slow and class-conditioned

Individuals accumulate **path dependence** via exposure histories.

---

## 9. Measurement Discipline (𝓜-Gated)

Measurement operator:

\[
\mathcal{M}_i:
O_i
\rightarrow
\hat{i}
\]

High-grade observables:
- task performance
- learning curves
- revealed behavior under constraint
- mobility and exit traces
- role persistence

Low-grade observables:
- stated beliefs
- survey attitudes
- moral narratives

Self-reports are weak evidence for causal inference.

---

## 10. MGA Integration

- **Used in:** MGA-A, MGA-B
- **Critical phases:**
  - Assumption Audit
  - Carrier Identification
  - Incentive Gradient Derivation
- **Required audits:**
  - Scale Consistency Audit
  - Selection vs Treatment Guardrail
  - Attribution Audit

Default disposition: **Bound**.

---

## 11. Misuse Prohibitions (Strict)

Invalid uses include:
- explaining macro outcomes via individual intent,
- treating individuals as direct policy levers,
- inferring beliefs from outcomes,
- collapsing individuals into averages,
- moralizing individual position.

Violations indicate **micro–macro collapse**.

---

## 12. Aliases and Lineage

- **Alias (technical):** agent (micro-level only)
- **Supersedes:** vague “people think/want” explanations
- **Superseded by:** none

---

## 13. Reduction Check (Robustness Contract)

As ΔO → 0:

> Individuals carry capacities and traits and respond to constraints; they do not govern systems.

All refinements collapse to a bounded carrier concept with unchanged semantics.
Object passes robustness, boundedness, and reduction requirements.
