# O.3.PATTERN.SALIENCE_DRIVEN_BASIN_HARDENING

## COR OBJECT HEADER

- **O_ID:** O.3.PATTERN.SALIENCE_DRIVEN_BASIN_HARDENING
- **Name:** Salience-Driven Basin Hardening (SDBH)
- **Order:** 3rd (Dynamic Pattern)  
- **Kind:** Pattern (Meta-Analytic; Non-Causal)
- **Role:** Descriptive dynamic pattern in which Information-field salience and penalty gradients, interacting with cognitive compression (COR.KAPPA↑) and boundary hardness (COR.H↑), drive ideological basins to harden, narrow, and separate across scale σ on manifold 𝓜, without requiring first-order regime-variable shifts or agentic coordination.
- **Status:** Canonical
- **Version:** 1.2
- **Changelog:**
  - v1.0: Canonical pattern definition; activation conditions, signatures, symmetry.
  - v1.1: Clarified non-causal status; aligned with field/operator language; added measurement discipline.
  - **v1.2:** Reconciled to explicitly reference **σ, 𝓜, Π_k, U_k, COR.KAPPA, COR.H, and T-operators**; tightened pattern vs mechanism boundaries; removed residual causal or proto-agentic phrasing; aligned with RLM and Projection Control layer.

## 0. Indexing, Non-Agency, and Pattern Form

**Indexing**
- **Manifold:** 𝓜
- **Scale:** σ (pattern is undefined without explicit σ)
- **Topology:** 𝒢(σ,t)

**Non-Agency Constraint (hard)**
- SDBH is a **pattern**, not a mechanism, actor, or force.
- It contains **no intent, no agency, no optimization, and no causal power**.
- SDBH **does not produce outcomes**; it labels a recurring configuration of dynamics arising from Fields, States, and RLMs.
- Any attribution of intent, coordination, or responsibility to SDBH is invalid.

---

## 1. Base Definition (O⁰)

**Salience-Driven Basin Hardening (SDBH)** is a **dynamic pattern** in which:

- heightened **salience** in the Information Field,
- combined with **penalty gradients** for deviation,
- interacting with **cognitive compression** (COR.KAPPA↑),
- and **boundary hardness** (COR.H↑),

produces **hardening, narrowing, and separation of ideological basins** at scale σ.

SDBH answers:

> *What recurring shape does ideological fragmentation take under these conditions?*

It does **not** answer:
- why actors choose actions,
- who is responsible,
- how to intervene,
- whether beliefs are true or false.

---

## 2. Pattern Skeleton (ΔO, Descriptive)

### 2.1 Canonical reinforcing configuration

A typical SDBH configuration exhibits:

1. **Salience shocks** enter the Information Field (events, symbols, crises).
2. Under **COR.KAPPA↑**, agents reduce dimensionality of interpretation.
3. **Π_I** amplifies frames that optimize for attention and penalty avoidance.
4. **COR.H↑** raises in-group enforcement and out-group exclusion.
5. Basin boundaries steepen; moderate positions lose stability.
6. Fragmentation and purity dynamics further increase salience.

This loop is **descriptive**, not causal or deterministic.

---

### 2.2 Symmetry property (locked)

SDBH is **ideologically symmetric**:

- Any ideological basin may harden under the same structural conditions.
- Which basins harden depends on **𝒢, Π_I, U_I, penalty gradients**, not moral content.

---

## 3. Formal Pattern Expression (Schematic, Non-Causal)

Let:

- \(\rho_I(x,\sigma,t)\): Information Field state
- \(\Pi_I\): Information propagation operator
- \(U_I\): information-relevant control surfaces
- \(\kappa(\sigma,t)\): cognitive compression state
- \(h(\sigma,t)\): boundary hardness state
- \(p(\sigma,t)\): penalty gradient magnitude
- \(\mathcal{G}(\sigma,t)\): coordination topology

SDBH corresponds to the **configuration** where:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\kappa &\uparrow \\
h &\uparrow \\
\text{Salience concentration in } \rho_I &\uparrow \\
\text{In-basin penalty gradients } p &\uparrow
\end{aligned}
\]

and where \(\Pi_I(\cdot;\mathcal{G},\sigma)\) yields **correlated convergence** within basins and **divergence** across basins.

No equation here implies causality; these are **pattern descriptors** only.

---

## 4. Dependencies (Required for Pattern Recognition)

SDBH may be identified only when all are present:

- **Information Field:** \(\rho_I, \Pi_I, U_I\)
- **States:** COR.KAPPA↑ and COR.H↑
- **Topology:** clustering or echo-supporting 𝒢
- **Penalty gradients:** social, economic, institutional, or platform-based
- **Scale:** σ explicitly specified

Absent any, SDBH must not be invoked.

---

## 5. Relationship to Mechanisms and Operators (Strict)

### 5.1 Relation to RLMs (non-causal)

SDBH is **downstream of**:
- O.2.RLM.INFORMATION_TOPOLOGY
- O.2.RLM.EXIT_LOCKIN (indirectly, via salience and threat)

It is **not itself** a mechanism and cannot substitute for RLM analysis.

---

### 5.2 Relation to T-Operators

SDBH does **not** perform scale transitions.

However:
- It may **co-occur** with T₄ (Cluster → Basin anchoring) when institutional anchoring occurs.
- It may **amplify salience** of clusters that later anchor into basins.

Claims of basin formation require explicit **T₄ evidence**, not SDBH alone.

---

## 6. Typical Correlated Effects (Non-Causal)

When SDBH is present, analysts often observe:

- shrinking admissible discourse range (Overton tightening)
- purity spirals and internal policing
- misclassification of MCI as MCR
- rising χ within aligned Groups, falling system-wide coherence
- increased governance and legitimacy stress

These are **correlations**, not guarantees.

---

## 7. Activation Conditions (Diagnostic Thresholds)

SDBH is diagnostically active when:

1. \(\kappa > \kappa^\*\)
2. \(h > h^\*\)
3. Salience distribution in \(\rho_I\) is highly concentrated
4. Penalty gradients are visible and asymmetric
5. 𝒢 supports clustering or rapid diffusion

Thresholds are regime- and σ-specific.

---

## 8. Observable Signatures (Measurement Bundle)

Invocation of SDBH requires **evidenced signatures**, such as:

- lexical compression and slogan dominance
- narrowing in-basin tolerance
- escalating sanctions for heterodoxy
- fragmentation into splinter basins
- salience driven by isolated incidents

Measurement operators (illustrative):
- \(\mathcal{M}_{\rho_I}\): attention/salience metrics
- \(\mathcal{M}_{\kappa}\): compression proxies
- \(\mathcal{M}_{h}\): boundary enforcement indicators
- \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{G}}\): clustering / assortativity

Narrative description alone is insufficient.

---

## 9. Scale and Time Properties

- **Scale:** emerges meso → macro via correlation length growth; not mean aggregation
- **Activation:** fast (shock- or salience-triggered)
- **Deactivation:** slow; requires COR.KAPPA↓ and penalty relaxation
- **Hysteresis:** high; once COR.H is elevated, decay is slow

---

## 10. MGA Integration

- **Used in:** MGA-B (mandatory if signatures present), MGA-C (constraint flag)
- **MGA-A:** optional descriptive annotation only
- **Required audits:**
  - Pattern-as-Descriptor Statement
  - Attribution Audit (no intent inference)
  - Scale Consistency Audit (explicit σ)
  - Measurement Validity Audit

Default disposition: **Descriptive only**.

---

## 11. Misuse Prohibitions (Non-Negotiable)

Invalid uses include:

- treating SDBH as a causal explanation
- inferring centralized coordination or cabals
- assigning blame or moral valence
- invoking SDBH without signatures and σ
- using SDBH to justify deterministic forecasts

Violations indicate **pattern reification** or **agency smuggling**.

---

## 12. Reduction Check (Robustness Contract)

As ΔO → 0:

> Under salience amplification with penalties, cognitive compression and boundary hardness tend to coincide with ideological hardening and fragmentation.

Pattern semantics preserved.
Object passes robustness, boundedness, and non-causality requirements.
