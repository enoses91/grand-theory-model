## COR OBJECT HEADER

* **O_ID:** `O.2.MEASUREMENT.PI_X`
* **Name:** π_X (Exit / Mobility Measurement Operator)
* **Order:** 2nd
* **Kind:** MeasurementOperator
* **Role:** Estimates effective exit availability (X) from migration, capital, participation, and substitution signals
* **Status:** Canonical
* **Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Base Definition

[
\pi_X:\ O_{exit} \rightarrow \langle \hat{X}, c \rangle
]

---

## 2. Observable Bundle

Channels (choose relevant ones):

* Migration / relocation flows (skill-weighted)
* Capital flows / firm relocation
* Labor churn and participation decline
* Jurisdictional arbitrage
* Parallel-institution uptake

---

## 3. Interpretation Rules

* Sustained net outflow ⇒ X high (for those agents)
* Asymmetry across classes must be stated explicitly
* Suppressed exit ≠ low desire to exit

---

## 4. MGA Integration

* Required for EXIT–LOCK-IN claims
* Required to diagnose delayed collapse
