# MEASUREMENT.PI_C.md

## COR OBJECT HEADER

* **O_ID:** `MEASUREMENT.PI_C`
* **Name:** π_C (Coordination Complexity Measurement Operator)
* **Order:** 2nd
* **Kind:** MeasurementOperator
* **Role:** Estimates effective coordination complexity load relative to execution capacity
* **Status:** Canonical
* **Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Base Definition

[
\pi_C:\ O_{coord} \rightarrow \langle \hat{C}, c \rangle
]

---

## 2. Observable Bundle

* Rule count and growth rate
* Exception and appeal frequency
* Backlog growth under stable demand
* Variance in outcomes for similar cases
* Discretionary overrides / workarounds

---

## 3. Interpretation Rules

* Rising variance + backlog ⇒ C increasing
* Adding safeguards increases C unless matched by COR.THETA
* Complexity reduction requires rule retirement evidence

---

## 4. MGA Integration

* Required to assert B_C binding
* Used in MGA-B Phase 6 & 7
